# Keylogger for Windows, Linux and Mac OS
Keylogger is a major tool in the surveillance technology. These are used to monitor how a user interacts with their keyboard as a means of recording their behavior, usage, or personal information. Keylogging tools are not illegal in and of themselves, they are often used in an illegal manner by cyberattackers, identity thieves, or other malicious users to surreptitiously steal information or track activity without user consent.
