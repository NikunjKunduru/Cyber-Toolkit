# Reverse Shell for Windows, Linux and Mac OS
The reverse shell's goal is to connect to a remote computer and redirect the input and output connections of the target systemâ€™s shell so the attacker can access it remotely. Reverse shells allow attackers to open ports to the target machines, forcing communication and enabling a complete takeover of the target machine. Therefore it is a severe security threat.

## What is this project about?
Implementing a reverse shell in Python using sockets that can execute remote shell commands and send the results back to the server.
